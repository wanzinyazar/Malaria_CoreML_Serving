This is the mobile version written in Swift for iOS. In the application I use core data and SQLite for local data storage. I use coreML for iOS for the machine learning component. The purpose of having locally stored ML models is so that our app can be used in places where there’s no internet and still be able to detect malaria.

The user will be able to save the patient’s data, such as their name and the generated results.
