# Malaria_iOS
Advancers.ai is a solution for malaria infected cell detection. This is the mobile version written in Swift for iOS. In the application we use core data and SQLite for local data storage.We use coreML for iOS for the machine learning component. The purpose of having locally stored ML models is so that our app can be used in places where there’s no internet and still be able to detect malaria.

Our iOS application utilizes Swift programming language, SQLite database and built-in UX/UI from Xcode. The application uses Artificial Intelligence to effectively diagnose Malaria. The user will be able to take a picture of the smeared blood sample and the application will take the picture and run our offline coreML file and produce the results, showing the percentages of parasitized and uninfected cells found in the blood sample. The user will be able to save the patient’s data, such as their name and the generated results.
